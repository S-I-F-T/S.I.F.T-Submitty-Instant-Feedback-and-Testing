**2/6 Work:**
Spent class time becoming familair with Figma and creating UI concepts for SIFT.
In Figma, I worked on two screen designs, those being the welcome page and the file upload screen for the autograder.
The images for the designs I worked on are uploaded in this branch as well.
For next class, I aim to further refine the designs I worked on and try to implement them using a library such as CustomTkInter.

**2/27 Work**
Since I was still unable to use customtkinter, I spent time researching other methods of creating good looking and effective UIs in Python. After researching and trying various things for a while, I came across an application called Tkinter Designer. This is an open source application which allows the user to take Figma frames and turn them into tkinter python files that closely match the Figma frames. The application can only do 1 frame at a time, and it has some issues, but they can be worked around. However, I continued to try to get customtkinter work as well.

**3/1 Work:**
This week I got customtkinter to work and began implementation of the UI for our application, mainly the welcome page and some of the autograder page.
