**2/6 Work:**
Spent class time becoming familair with Figma and creating UI concepts for SIFT.
In Figma, I worked on two screen designs, those being the welcome page and the file upload screen for the autograder.
The images for the designs I worked on are uploaded in this branch as well.
For next class, I aim to further refine the designs I worked on and try to implement them using a library such as CustomTkInter.
