Docker is a tool used to package and distribute software without needing to install all the various parts individually. Docker containers are the way this is accomplished. Containers hold all the various parts of an application such as source code, libraries, dependencies, runtimes, etc. These containers can be used to create "images" that essentially run the program. Images can be uploaded to cloud platforms like DockerHub, AWS, etc to allow other people to download and run them. Docker also has a feature called volumes. Volumes can be used to maintain files related to containers that persist even after the container has stopped running, and be used by other containers. This is useful for storing information that needs to be retrieved later.
