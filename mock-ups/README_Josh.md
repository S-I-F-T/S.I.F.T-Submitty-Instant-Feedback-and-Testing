Joshua's progress: Today I worked in figma in order to make mock ups for S.I.F.T
More specifically I worked on the results screen and the file upload screens.
Next time, I plan on integrating these mock ups and learning how to make them using tkinter.

I am learning as I go. Next week , I plan on making more progress on the frontend.

This week I started applying what I learned about tkinter to start making the front end of our project. I started working on the file upload page for our application. The goal was to produce something similar to Submitty's gradable upload page, but there are two sections to put the student generated code, and another section to upload the expected output files to compare the student's code to.
